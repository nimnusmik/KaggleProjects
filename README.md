## üìù Project Details

### 1. Predict Calorie Expenditure
- **Objective**: Predict calorie expenditure using regression techniques.
- **Dataset**: Requires a dataset with features such as age, weight, and activity level (available on Kaggle).
- **Methodology**:
  - Data preprocessing with Pandas
  - Model training with Scikit-learn (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)
  - Evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Notebook**: Located in `1. Predict Calorie Expenditure/`

### 2. Vegetable Classification
- **Objective**: Classify vegetables using image data.
- **Dataset**: Requires an image dataset of vegetables (available on Kaggle).
- **Methodology**:
  - Image preprocessing with TensorFlow
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification
  - Evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix
- **Notebook**: Located in `2. Vegetable Classification/`

---

## üí° Usage Notes
- **Dataset Placement**: Ensure datasets are placed in the respective project folders as specified in the notebooks.
- **Vegetable Classification**: Images should be organized in subdirectories by class (e.g., `dataset/vegetables/carrot/`).
- **Environment**: Always activate the virtual environment before running the notebooks to avoid dependency conflicts.
